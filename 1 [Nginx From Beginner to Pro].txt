1. Nginx
	three dominated web servers
		Apache, Microsoft IIS, Nginx

	reasons to use Nginx
		extremely fast
		it can be used to take care of routing traffic to the back end intelligently
			which will accelerate your application
		it has a straightforward software load balancer
			setting up a hardware load balancer is costly
		it scales well
			scalibility and performance are not the same problem
			Apache and IIS servers are not suitable for large amount of conenctions due to their architechture
				Nginx is event-driven, similar to Node.js, which makes it scalable
		you can reconfigure and upgrade it on the fly
		affordable to install and maintain
			it performs pretty well even on servers with a very low hardware footprint
		easy to use

2. main features of Nginx
	more than just a web server
		Nginx can be considered to be an event-based reverse proxy server
		reverse proxy
			retrieves resources from the servers on behalf of a client
			can be helpful to offload the number of requests that the actual web server ends up handling

	modular design
		extremely extensible due to its support for plug-ins
		you can rebuild Nginx from source and include or exclude the modules that you don't need

	asynchronous web server
		while IIS and Apache like to spin new threads per connection, which are blocking in nature

	reverse proxy and load balancing capability
		it analyzes the request based on its URI and decides how to proceed with it
	
	low resource requirement and consumption
		while other web servers typically allow a simple plug-and-play architecture for plug-ins using configuration files
			Nginx requires a recompilation of the source with required modules
			every module is loaded directly inside of an Nginx process

	multiple protocol support
		HTTP(S), WebSocket, IMAP, POP3, SMTP

	SSL termination
		since decrypting takes time, when using Nginx as a load balancer, you can terminate SSL at Nginx, i.e. relaying requests to other web servers without SSL
	
	HTTP video streaming using MP4/FLV/HDS/HLS
		video streaming is a very IO-intensive process
		and Nginx is good at IO due to its asynchronism
	
	extended monitoring and logging
		error log	you can configure it to log based on its levels
		access log	you can change the fields you would like to log

	upgrades without downtime
		you just use some commands to run some newer worker processes with new configurations loaded to them, and new requests will be sent to the new workers
	
3. enterprise features of Nginx Plus
	advanced HTTP and TCP load balancing
		there are four methods of load balancing Nginx
			Round-Robin, Least Connections, Generic Hash, IP Hash
		one more in Nginx Plus
			least time
	
	session persistence
		when you have multiple servers, it might not be easy to share the session data
			which means if a request from a logged-in client goes to a different server, a reauthentication will be required
		Nginx Plus solves this
	
	content caching enhanced capabilities
		Nginx Plus can cache content in the local disks and served as if it is coming from the origin
		it also allows purging of cache, to avoid sending older files
	
	application health checks
		continually test the upstream servers and instruct Nginx Plus to avoid servers that have failed
		could be one of the biggest reasons to use Nginx Plus
	
	HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and Video on Demand (VOD)
		other than progressive downloads, Nginx Plus provides adaptive streaming
		and also bandwidth management for MP4 media
	
	live activity monitoring
		a GUI
	
4. Nginx vs Apache
	Nginx as front end server and Apache in the back end gives you the best of both worlds
	Aoache has built-in support for PHP, Python, Perl and many other languages
		Nginx almost always requires extra efforts to work with these languages

5. installing Nginx
	some basic utilities you'll need ('yum install' on CentOS)
		Lynx	a text based browser
		wget	a text based downloader that will help download files
		ssh	a secure shell to allow remote login
	
	install Nginx pre-built package
		add Nginx repository to the server repository list
			create a file named nginx.repo inside /etc/yum.repos.d
			add the following to nginx.repo
				[nginx]
				name=nginx repo
				baseurl=http://nginx.org/packages/centos/7/$basearch
				pgpcheck=0
				enabled=1
		install it
			# yum install nginx
